# Second Hackathon : Hackathon Auto-matic !

It ran for 60 hours, and it was a success !

### What we did this last week :
- The judges @George Christopoulos @Jeet @Arka @annaSWE @Roza reviewed the last hackathon's contestents' submissions and graded it
- We announced the winners, and gave them badges (for all the participants and for the 3 winners)
- We launched the second hackathon : Hackathon Auto-matic
- We set up a Google Drive and put there all the important information to better organize our preparations
- We set up an inclass competition in this Hackathon, so participants can see their progress on the Leaderboard
- This time, we were better prepared, as we learned from last time's hackathon, so we took care of notifying the participants of submitting their predicitions and a CSV file, and we added 12 hours to the hackathon for committing the kernel.
- We answered the contestents' questions with the help of the judges
- We used as a topic the "Cars Classification Dataset"  : https://www.kaggle.com/c/virtual-hack, we had 23 teams of participants
- We sent a Feedback form for the contestents' to fill, so we can learn what to do better for the next Hackathon
