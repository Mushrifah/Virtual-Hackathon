# Fourth Hackathon : Hackathon SENTIMENTO-V2 !

It is still going on right now.

### What we did this last week :
- We made a major change : we changed the 48h format of the hackathon to a 5 day hackathon (after a vote by the majority of the participants), so they now have 120 hours to submit their kernels. This decision was modified by the fact that there is a lot of projects going on right at the same time, so participants couldn't submit their final work as well as they wanted to do.
- We also switched from computer vision hackathons to NLP hackathons.
- The judges @annaSWE, @George Christopoulos and @Arka reviewed the last hackathon's (Hackathon SENTIMENTO V1) contestents' submissions and graded it
- We announced the winners, and gave them badges (for all the participants and for the 3 winners)
- We launched the **fourth** hackathon : Hackathon Auto-matic
- We answered the contestents' questions with the help of the judges
- We used as a topic the "**Sentiment Analysis with tweets**"  : https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-hack
