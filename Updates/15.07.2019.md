# We finally organized our hackathon this weekend ! 

It ran for 48hours + 24h (so it's still running right now), and it's a success !

Some facts : 
- We added the 24h so people that haven't submitted their predictions can do it, since most participants didn't know about this step of the competition
- Although we started the hackathon with 11 teams, we ended up having **41 teams participating** ! Each team has between 1 and 4 members.
- We answered everyone's questions with the help of our judges : @George Stephanopoulos @Jeet @Arka @AnnaSWE
- We kept the study group's channel alive by regularly posting new announcements, such as *recaps of questions*, or *new updates* about 
the hackathon.
- We used as a topic the "Flower Classification Dataset" that was a project in the last Python Scholarship (Here's the link : https://www.kaggle.com/spaics/datasets)
- We made the badges that we will give to the first three winners and the participants.
