# We finally organized our hackathon this weekend ! 

It ran for 48hours, and was a success ! 

Some facts : 
- Although we started the hackathon with 11 teams, we ended up having **41 teams participating** ! Each team has between 1 and 4 members.
- We answered everyone's questions with the help of our judges : @George Stephanopoulos @Jeet @Arka @AnnaSWE
- We kept the study group's channel alive by regularly posting new announcements, such as *recaps of questions*, or *new updates* about 
the hackathon.
- We used as a topic the "Flower Classification Dataset" that was a project in the last (Here's the link : https://www.kaggle.com/spaics/datasets)
- We made te badges that we will give to the first three winners and the participants.
