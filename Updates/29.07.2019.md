# Third Hackathon : Hackathon SENTIMENTO-V1 !

It lasted 60 hours. (added time for submission of the kernel)

### What we did this week :
- We also switched from computer vision hackathons to NLP hackathons.
- The judges @George Christopoulos and @Arka reviewed the last hackathon's (Hackathon Auto-matic) contestents' submissions and graded it
- We announced the winners, and gave them badges (for all the participants and for the 3 winners)
- We launched the **third** hackathon : Hackathon SENTIMENTO-V1
- We answered the contestents' questions with the help of the judges
- We used as a topic the "**Sentiment Analysis**"  : https://www.kaggle.com/c/virtual-hackathon
