# Fifth Hackathon : Hackathon Forecast !

It is still going on right now.

### What we did this last week :
- We launched the **fifth** hackathon : Hackathon Forecast
- We chose a hackathon that was a Google competition to motivate people to join, so it's the "Web Traffic Time Series Forecasting" that can be found here :https://www.kaggle.com/c/web-traffic-time-series-forecasting/overview
- Our judge @George Christopoulos the last hackathon's (Hackathon SENTIMENTO V2) contestents' submissions and graded it
- We announced the winners, and gave them badges (for all the participants and for the 3 winners)
