Important Announcements
-- 

- **DO NOT** make your kernel public while the hackathon is still running.

**DO** make it public after **Monday 23:59 GMT**. Any modification to your kernel code after that time counts as disqualification.

This is to avoid risks of people copying each other's code.

- We have now uploaded the test set into Kaggle under the name "test set.zip", so you can finally test your model!

# Check In 

Hello guys, just checking in. How's it going?.  Hope you all are having fun.
You guys are doing a great job so far, keep the momentum going 

Please remember to post pics of you working on the hackathon so that others get to motivated to continue and take a coffee break 

Here are some commonly asked questions in the Hackathon Auto-matic

1. Are we doing the submissions based on the current test set provided? or another test set will be provided later on?
No, no test set will be provided later. The current test set should be used to test your model. The training data should be divided into train and validation set


2. What is id and predicted in the submission file?
The test images are named in this format 00076.jpg so id in submission.csv is the name of the file that is 00076 (without the extension .jpg) and predicted is the class value which you get


3. When I print names.head(), I get AM General Hummer SUV 200 in the header. Is this an error?
No, this is not an error. You should add a header to the dataframe so that the values appear under the header


4. Do I have to print the predicted values in the kernel eventhough I'll submit the csv file?
Yes, You have to print the values in the kernel and also submit these predicted values in a csv file

# 6 HOURS TO GO 
It's been 54hours into the hackathon!
Wow, you've all worked so hard
We hope you guys are having a great time ! 

Just posting a kind reminder that if you haven't committed your kernel, please start committing it now, cause time is running out. After Monday 11:59am GMT, you can start making your kernels public.  Just to remind you about the rules , in case you committed your kernel without doing them.
It is MANDATORY to the following:

1. Name your kernels using the format TeamName:KernelName.

2. Print your predicted values on the kernel before sending it to the csv file (this will ensure no one edited the csv file or cheated in anyway).

3.  Print the Training Loss and Training Accuracy at the end of the notebook.

4. Print the Validation Loss and Validation Accuracy at the end of the notebook.

5. Print AUC Score at the end of the notebook.

6. Finally, submit a CSV file with format Id, Predicted - see sampleSubmission.csv for more details.

Thanks and wish you all the best
