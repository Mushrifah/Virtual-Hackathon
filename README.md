# Virtual-Hackathon
Participate in virtual hackathon for scholars of [Secure and Private AI Scholarship 
Challenge from Facebook](https://eu.udacity.com/facebook-AI-scholarship) conducted by #sg_hackathon_orgnizrs. Come join us let's for a fun filled weekend of coding and competing against each other.


## When is it?
- Hackathon starts => **Saturday 00:01am GMT  to Monday 11:59am GMT** .
- Coding Time => **Saturday 00:01am GMT  to Sunday 11:59pm GMT**.
- Commiting Kernel => **Sunday 00:01am GMT  to Monday 11:59am GMT**.


## Where is it?
Active Hackathon: https://www.kaggle.com/spaics/hackathon-blossom-flower-classification


## How to participate?
Use this form to sign up. You can participate alone or as part of a team of up to 4 individuals. Only 1 member of the team needs to fill the form. http://bit.ly/hackathon-signup. Please join the #sg_hackathon-orgnizrs channel to get the announcements and ask questions.


## How will submissions be evaluated?
Submissions will be evaluated by members of the community with a background in DS, DL or ML on the following criteria: **accuracy**, **accuracy (loss) on unseen data**, **model efficiency**, **time of commit**.


## 5. When will results be announced?
On Thursday.


## RULES
1. Teams should be made up of at most 4 individuals.
2. Kernels must be committed before **Sunday @ 11:59pm GMT**. No points are gained for submitting before this time but all submissions after this time will not be accepted. **Any teams that make any changes to their kernel after this time will be disqualified**
3. Please include short description/summary of your
 - Model architecture and hyperparameters.
 - and Why you used these models.
 should be included at the top of your kernel (1st or 2nd cell).
 This will be give our judges an idea about what you have done.
 
Please check in every 8hrs in the #sg_hackathon-orgnizrs, so we know you are still there :). Feel free to send pictures of you or your team working on the hackathon, send text messages or motivational messages to motivate your peers. 

# Here are the most commonly asked question :

**1. Is there any restriction to frameworks ?**

Yes since this scholarship is related to pytorch we are restricting the use with PYTORCH only


**2. Can we use colab for training since my model is taking a lot of time with kaggle kernel?**

You can work on Google colab then download your notebook and upload the notebook in your kaggle kernel . We want all the kernels to be under that dataset for easy access. Please upload your notebook to the kaggle kernel before the submission time and make it private till the submission time.


**3. Do we have to make the kernel public?**

Please, DO NOT make your kernel public while the hackathon is still running.
DO make it public after Sunday 23:59 GMT. Any modification to kernel code after that time counts as disqualification.


**4. What if am sleeping the time for making the kernel public ?**

You can make your kernel public when you wake up (on Monday) but please don't add any modification to the kernel after the submit time as that time counts as disqualification. And if you are working on Google Colab , please upload your notebook to the kaggle kernel before the submission time to be on the safe side.


**5. How can I add my team members ?**

When you create a new kernel in the right hand side you will find settings there will be an option for sharing click on that and add your team members as collaborators.

**6. Can we participate in the hackathon after the hackathon starts?**

Yes the hackathon is open for the whole weekend so you guys can fill in the form and start it now also
